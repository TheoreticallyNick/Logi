DEVICE DEPLOYEMENT NOTES

Date: 4/7/20
    Task: Retrieve and assess deployed devices from the field
    Notes: 
        - Logi15 was found to have a build up of water in the bottom of the enclosure, by the batteries
        - It has been determined that it is best to start the device from home and deploy without
            opening the enclosure
        - Batteries last surprisingly long, over three weeks with the current setup, much longer than anticipated
        - Logi31 did not have any water intrusion and was fully sealed when found
