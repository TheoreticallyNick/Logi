DEVICE DEPLOYEMENT NOTES

Date: 4/7/20
    Task: Retrieve and assess deployed devices from the field
    Notes: 
        - Logi15 was found to have a build up of water in the bottom of the enclosure, by the batteries
        - It has been determined that it is best to start the device from home and deploy without
            opening the enclosure
        - Batteries last surprisingly long, over three weeks with the current setup, much longer than anticipated
        - Logi31 did not have any water intrusion and was fully sealed when found

Date: 4/30/20
    Task: Logi29 Not Sending Messages for Over Three Days
    Notes: 
        - Internally, everything was intact
        - Logi connected properly and did not show any signs of software problems or runtime issues
        - The USB Nova dongle was turning on and off sporadically, indicating that it was somehow damaged -- will be investigating.
        - The error mode can be found in the logs under Logi29 - 4.30.20

Date: 5/8/20
    Task: Logi Retrieval from the Field after 20+ Days
    Notes: 
        - No visible issues related to the devices running into an error    
        - Suspect the primary source of lost signal is due to running out of battery
        - Traces of water found inside the enclosure, suspect water vapor condensation

    Task: Logi Retrieval from Field
    Notes:
        - Logi29 lost contact after 3 days, multiple ERR121, suspect not enough power to power the dongle effectively.
        - Logi31 lost power after 11 pings
        - Logi15 lost power after 15 pings.
    Resolution: 
        - Ensuring full charge before deployement
        - Design out the WACO clips - go direct for a hard solder.
